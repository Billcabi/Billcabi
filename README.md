I am learning how to use the google colabs to run pandas and python. I am interested in computer vision and how computer see.
My grandson is 12 and loves learning about coding and creating games. He is using scratch to make a game like flappy bird. 
The goal of this git spot is to create a shared place where we both can mess around with some cool ideas.
We have been building a web site for our stuff as well. It would be nice if my other 13 year old grandson would participate as well. 
He is also a great artist that wants to learn 3d graphics. This is an area I would love to learn too. Anyone who has any lessons for us that would be great. 
Eventually I will include links to all of our online social media sites. We also live in a poor reception area for internet thank God for the library.
